You are a senior React Native and Expo graphics engineer.

Generate a production-ready React Native component in TypeScript for an AI-style image scanning animation that runs ONLY on mobile (iOS and Android) using Expo.

IMPORTANT:
- This must work inside an Expo managed workflow.
- Do NOT use React Three Fiber.
- Do NOT assume DOM or web APIs.
- Use expo-gl and expo-three with raw Three.js.
- Optimize for mobile performance.

Technical Requirements:

1. Use GLView from expo-gl to create the WebGL context.
2. Use expo-three’s Renderer to render a Three.js scene.
3. Accept a prop:
   imageUrl: string
4. Load the image texture using Three.js TextureLoader.
5. Render a full-screen plane with a custom ShaderMaterial.
6. Write custom GLSL vertex and fragment shaders.
7. Animate using a uniform `uTime` updated inside a requestAnimationFrame loop.
8. Call gl.endFrameEXP() properly after rendering.

AI SCANNING EFFECT REQUIREMENTS:

Create a futuristic AI scanning effect that includes:

• A vertical scanning band moving smoothly from bottom to top.
• Bright cyan/blue neon glow where the band passes.
• Soft bloom-like glow boost (fake bloom inside shader).
• Subtle horizontal UV distortion inside the scan band.
• Light grid overlay behind or blended with the image.
• Slight flicker noise inside the band to simulate “AI analysis”.
• Smoothstep-based band falloff.
• Looping animation.

Performance Constraints (Mobile Optimized):

• Avoid heavy postprocessing.
• Avoid large geometry counts.
• Use a single plane mesh.
• Avoid dynamic allocations in render loop.
• Use mediump precision in fragment shader.
• Ensure texture is properly sized and not reloaded per frame.
• Cleanly dispose resources on unmount.

Structure:

- Functional component named `ImageScanner`
- Uses useRef for time
- Contains onContextCreate function
- Creates scene, orthographic camera, plane geometry
- Creates ShaderMaterial with uniforms:
    uTexture
    uTime
- Proper animation loop
- Proper cleanup (cancel animation frame on unmount)

Code Quality:

- Fully typed TypeScript.
- Clear comments explaining shader math.
- Clean formatting.
- No pseudo code.
- Must be copy-paste runnable in an Expo project.

Extra polish:

Add configurable props (optional but preferred):
- scanSpeed?: number
- glowColor?: [number, number, number]

Deliver a single complete file component.
No explanation text.
Only output the final code.
