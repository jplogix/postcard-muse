Use ElevenLabs timestamps + animated text reveal
Why?

If you rely on just audio duration, your sync will drift.
If you use timestamps from ElevenLabs, it will feel professionally aligned.

Step 1 — Get timestamps from ElevenLabs

Use their API with alignment metadata enabled.
You’ll receive per-word timestamps like:

{
  "words": [
    { "text": "Hello", "start": 0.0, "end": 0.4 },
    { "text": "world", "start": 0.5, "end": 0.9 }
  ]
}

This is gold. Now you know exactly when each word is spoken.

🧠 Step 2 — Play audio in Expo

Use:

expo install expo-av

Then:

import { Audio } from 'expo-av'

const sound = new Audio.Sound()
await sound.loadAsync({ uri: audioUrl })
await sound.playAsync()
🎬 Step 3 — Animate text based on playback position

Use:

npm install react-native-reanimated

Then track playback time:

sound.setOnPlaybackStatusUpdate((status) => {
  if (status.isLoaded) {
    setCurrentTime(status.positionMillis / 1000)
  }
})

Now compare currentTime with each word's start time.

✍️ Rendering Word-by-Word
{words.map((word, i) => (
  <Animated.Text
    key={i}
    style={[
      styles.text,
      {
        opacity: currentTime >= word.start ? 1 : 0,
      },
    ]}
  >
    {word.text + " "}
  </Animated.Text>
))}

This gives you perfect sync.

✍️ Making It Look Handwritten

Use a handwritten font like:

Caveat

Pacifico

Indie Flower

In Expo:

expo install expo-font

Load Google font:

import * as Font from 'expo-font'

Then style:

fontFamily: 'Caveat-Regular',
fontSize: 28,
✨ Want REAL “Writing Stroke” Effect?

If you want the letters to draw like ink appearing (not just fade-in), you have two better options:

Option A — Mask Reveal Animation (Smooth & Native)

Use:

@react-native-masked-view/masked-view
react-native-svg
react-native-reanimated

Animate a mask sliding over the text to simulate writing.

This looks clean and works well in Expo.

Option B — SVG Path Drawing (Ultra Realistic)

Convert text to SVG paths and animate stroke:

<AnimatedPath
  strokeDasharray={length}
  strokeDashoffset={animatedValue}
/>

This gives true pen-drawing animation.

Downside: More setup.

🧩 Which Should You Use?
Goal	Recommendation
Simple & clean	Word fade-in with timestamps
Premium storytelling app	Mask reveal
“AI scanning handwritten prophecy” cinematic look	SVG stroke animation
⚡ Performance Tip (Important)

Do NOT re-render full paragraph on every millisecond update.

Instead:

Store active word index

Only update when index changes

Much smoother on mobile.

🏆 My Personal Recommendation For You

Since you're building polished apps:

Use:

ElevenLabs timestamps

expo-av for playback

react-native-reanimated

Mask reveal for handwriting illusion

That combo feels modern and premium.
